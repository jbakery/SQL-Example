
Aggregating and Grouping Data

These SQL queries are from a real estate data base showing house properities and home sale values.
The attempt is to show fluid SQL skills. 

Question 1,

Write a query that selects the average lotarea (rounded to 2 decimals) per yearbuilt where the street is not gravel (Grvl) and lotconfig is a corner (Corner). 
Moreover, select only the average lotareas greater than 1,000, and sort your results by yearbuilt from oldest to newest.
HINT: Within the first line of your query, use this code so that the proper datatype is used to avoid results displaying in scientific notation:

SELECT yearbuilt, ROUND(AVG(lotarea),2)::float 
FROM houseprices
WHERE street NOT IN('Grvl') AND lotconfig = 'Corner'
GROUP BY yearbuilt
HAVING AVG(lotarea) > 1000
ORDER BY yearbuilt

Question 2,

Write a query that shows the average overall quality overallqual (rounded to 0 decimals and renamed as avg_quality) 
and the number of unique garage types (garagetype) renamed as garage_count for each neighborhood sorted by neighborhood, 
being careful to not include NULL values.
HINT: Within the first line of your query, use this code so that the proper datatype is used to avoid results displaying in scientific notation:

SELECT neighborhood, ROUND(AVG(overallqual),0)::integer AS avg_quality, COUNT(DISTINCT(garagetype)) AS garage_count
FROM houseprices
GROUP BY neighborhood
ORDER BY neighborhood;

Question 3,

Write a query that shows, for each yearbuilt, how many houses had a lotarea between 10,000 and 15,000, 
inclusive. Finally, order it by yearbuilt from oldest to newest.

SELECT COUNT(lotarea), yearbuilt
FROM houseprices
WHERE lotarea BETWEEN 10000 AND 15000
GROUP BY yearbuilt
ORDER BY yearbuilt
